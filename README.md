# Weather App

Project to create a weather app with API data that show main weather for today and forecast weather for upcoming days.

## The problem

We approached the project as a team first planning on how we wanted to structure the app layout, did some first code on a master branch. Then we split up
in two teams on feature branches for main weather and forecast. After that we merged the branches togheter and finalized it with more addons afterwards.

We used API:s, addeventlisteners, functions, dom-selectors, if/else conditionals etc...

Some difficulties with the structure when it came to planning as a team. If we had more time we would've liked to plan even more and add Geo Location and more fun stuff.
